# Quadruped
Design and development of an autonomous four legged robot.

Quadruped is an autonomous robot capable of locomotion with four legs. Each leg requires three degrees of freedom and hence three independent high torque motors for its function. The quadruped will be controlled by a microprocessor capable of interpreting environment data through sensors and camera live feed, in turn controlling the signals given to motors for locomotion. In addition there would be a power supply in form of a lithium battery. We are currently studying about the mathematical models that can be implemented by analysing research papers already published. We are also looking for other locomotion mechanisms for optimised movement. After mastering manual movement, we will implement mathematical models and auto correction algorithms to make the movement of the bot autonomous.
The final quadruped woud be capable of locomotion independent of any human interference based on sensory input it receives. It has several real life applications, few of them being - These bots can be used as payload carrying animals and completing various life endangering tasks for humans example Bomb Disposal or exploring difficult terrains. The bot with better algorithms and sensor inputs will be able to mimic animal behaviour and will help in better understanding of animal behaviour.

**So why this project ?**

We got inspiration for quadruped from Spot Mini of Boston Dynamics. Have you seen it ? If not, check this out UpTown Spot. REALLY Cool!!

**What all will it be able to do?**

Similar to Spot Mini, our Quadruped will be capable of autonomous locomotion, along with weight carrying capabilities. Our Bot will be equipped with cameras for path plotting and obstacle avoidance along with other sensors that will provide the bot with data about its surroundings. Additionally we will try to improve its appearance and behaviour (interaction with environment), thus making it capable of interacting with living beings as well just like a real animate object.

**How we intend to do it ?**

We are having two designs for quadruped one actuated using servos on a small scale, another actuated via hydraulics on a greater scale. The following process is common in both the designs-

a) Simulation of motion using MATLAB tool simscape.
b) Designing using Fusion 360.
c) Design analysis on Ansys.
d) Motion planning by algorithmic video processing.
e) 3D printing the parts of Quadruped.
f) Testing the bot in real world scenario.
